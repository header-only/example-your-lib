# A library made with `#inglued <>`: highly dependent but easy to ship.
This demonstrate the use of the [#inglued <>](https://github.com/header-only/inglued) project, by showing how to make a **modern c++ header-only library**.

This shows how an highly dependent library can be shipped as a single package, with all it's dependencies bundled, without the library user having to know anything of the dependency management system.
